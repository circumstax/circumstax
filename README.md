Circumstax
==========

*State management in PHP done in a frontend concept.*

# What is the use case
I ran into a problem with managing my state in a turn based game I was creating in the [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/).
In the TALL stack you have a framework called Livewire.
This is basically a frontend framework where you develop in the backend.
That is where I ran into a problem where I needed more features to manage the multiple states in the game.

As of now this is still a development build that I intend to use in the game and develop the circumstax from there.

# Under Construction

The rest of the documentation is under construction.
